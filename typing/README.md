# Type Deduction

## Type Deduction Guide

briefly explained by C++ templates: complete guide, L2000

however the examples it gave was not intuitive (and it didn't work)

I found another post from Microsoft that made more sense:

<https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/how-to-use-class-template-argument-deduction/>

> Here are two of the most common cases for deduction guides in the STL: 
> iterators and perfect forwarding.
