# Type Deduction

## Type Deduction Guide

briefly explained by C++ templates: complete guide, L2000

however the examples it gave was not intuitive (and it didn't work)

I found another post from Microsoft that made more sense:

<https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/how-to-use-class-template-argument-deduction/>

> Here are two of the most common cases for deduction guides in the STL: 
> iterators and perfect forwarding.

## Type Metaprogramming (type-driven)

see: c++ template: complete guide L18381

L18612

> a comprehensive metaprogramming solution for C++ must make choices along three
> dimensions
> computation
> reflection
> generation
